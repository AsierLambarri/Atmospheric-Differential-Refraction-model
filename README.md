# Atmospheric-Differential-Refraction-model
This is an 'interactive' implementation of Alexei V. Filippenkos model (1982) ([1982PASP...94..715F](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982PASP...94..715F/abstract)) for atmospheric differential refraction in python. The effects of atmospheric Seeing are also modeled. Both of these effects need to be accounted for when, for example, a fiber spectrograph, in order to collect all the light-beam comming from the object under study.
