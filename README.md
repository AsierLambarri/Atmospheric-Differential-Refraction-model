# Atmospheric-Differential-Refraction-model
This is an 'interactive' implementation of Alexei V. Filippenkos model (1982) ([1982PASP...94..715F](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982PASP...94..715F/abstract)) for atmospheric differential refraction in python. The effects of atmospheric Seeing are also modeled. Both of these effects need to be accounted for when, for example, a fiber spectrograph, in order to collect all the light-beam comming from the object under study. The existence of this mini-project has been inspired by VNathir's owns implementation.

## The code

The code is implemented such that the user can input, either via the Terminal or through a .txt or .csv file, the Wavelengths at which the model is to be evaluated and the Atmospheric conditions (that may be different for each of the wavelengths) for each of them, the reference wavelength to compute the 'differential' part of the model and the Fried Parameters to model the Seeing. The `.py` file is self-contained and doesnt need anything else (except for a couple packages). To run it, enter in the Terminal: `pythonX_AtmosphericDispersion_Filippenko1982.py`.

The outputs are: a .png image that represents the deviations and seeings at a few different angles and a .ecsv file (generated with astropy) containing 20 model evaluations between 0ยบ and 80ยบ (for all the wavelengths and atm cond. provided) that you can (re-)use to numerically model the Seeing and Diff. Refraction on you own projects: it is better to generate data once than to go back every now and then.

The 'program' displays all the necesary information for its correct usage when you run it.
